// Cases where Wikidata is best.
// A cool thing about this is that Wikidata is an open dataset, so if you encounter any issues,
// you can always fix it there, fixing it for the entire world.
// If the unlocode wasn't in code-list-improved.csv before, it should show up automatically after running download-wikidata.js and generate-improved-coordinates.js
// Otherwise, you'd have to add the unlocode here
